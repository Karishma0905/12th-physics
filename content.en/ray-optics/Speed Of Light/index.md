## SPEED OF LIGHT

Light travels with the highest speed in vacuum. The speed of light in vacuum is denoted as _c_ and its value is, _c_ = 3 × 108 m s-1. The earliest attempt to determine the speed of light was made by a French scientist Hippolyte Fizeau (1819–1896). That paved way for the other scientists too to determine the speed of light.

### Fizeau’s method to determine speed of light

_Apparatus_: The apparatus used by Fizeau for determining speed of light in air medium is shown in Figure 6.13. The light from the source _S_ was first allowed to fall on a partially silvered glass plate _G_ kept at an angle of 45o to the incident light. The light then was allowed to pass through a rotating toothed-wheel with _N_ teeth and _N_ cuts of equal widths whose speed of rotation could be varied through an external mechanism (not shown in the Figure). The light passing through one cut

in the wheel will get reflected by a mirror _M_ kept at a long distance _d_, about 8 _km_ from the toothed-wheel. If the toothed- wheel was not rotating, the light reflected back from the mirror would again pass through the same cut and reach the eyes of the observer who looks through the partially silvered glass plate.

_Working_: The angular speed of rotation of the toothed-wheel was increased from zero to a value _ω_ until the light passing through one cut would completely be blocked by the adjacent tooth. This is ensured by the disappearance of the light while looking through the partially silvered glass plate.

_Expression for speed of light_: The speed _v_ of light in air is equal to the ratio of the distance 2_d_ (the distance light travelled from the toothed-wheel to the mirror and back), to the time taken _t_.

_v_ \= 2_d t_

(6.12)

The distance _d_ is a known value from the arrangement. The time _t_ taken for the



  

light to travel the distance 2_d_ is calculated from the angular speed _ω_ of the toothed- wheel.

The angular speed _ω_ (with unit rad s–1) of the toothed-wheel when the light disappeared for the first time is,

_w q_ \=

_t_ (6.13)

Here, _θ_ is the angle between one tooth and the next slot which is turned within that time _t_.

_q_ \= total angle of the circle in radian number of teeth+number of cuts

_q p p_\= 2 2_N N_

\=

Substituting _θ_ in equation (6.13),

_w p p_\= / _N t Nt_

\=

Rewriting the above equation for t,

_t N_

\= _p w_

(6.14)

Substituting this in equation (6.12),

_v_ \= 2_d Np w_/

After rearranging,

_v_ \= 2_dNw p_

(6.15)

Fizeau had some difficulty to visually estimate the minimum intensity of the light when it is blocked by the adjacent tooth. The value of speed of light determined by him was very close to the actual value. Later on, with the same idea of Fizeau and with much sophisticated instruments, the speed of light in air was determined as, _v_ = 2.99792 × 108 m s–1.  

After the disappearance of light for the first time while increasing the speed

of rotation of the toothed-wheel from zero to ω, on further increasing the speed of rotation to 2_ω_, the light would appear again due to the passing of reflected light through the next slot. So, for every odd value of ω, light would disappear (stopped by tooth) and for every even value of ω light would appear (allowed by slot).

**Note**

### Speed of light through vacuum and different media

Scientists like Foucault (1819–1868) and Michelson (1852–1931) introduced different transparent media like glass, water etc., in the path of light to find the speed of light in different media. Even evacuated glass tubes were also introduced in the path of light to find the speed of light in vacuum. It was found that light travels with lesser speed in any medium than its speed in vacuum. The speed of light in vacuum was determined as, _c_ = 3 × 108 m s-1. We could notice that the speed of light in vacuum and speed of light in air are almost same.

### Refractive index

**_Refractive index_ of a transparent medium is defined as the ratio of speed of light in vacuum _c_ to the speed of light in that medium** _v_**.**

medium =

Refractive index of a transparent medium gives an idea about the speed of light in that medium.

Light travels with a speed of 2.26 × 108 m s-1 through pure water.

Refractive index does not have a unit. The smallest value of refractive index is for vacuum, which is 1. For any other medium refractive index is greater than 1. Refractive index is also called as optical density of the medium. Higher the refractive index of a medium, lesser is the speed of light through it and vice-versa. \[Note: optical density should not be confused with mass density of the material of the medium. They two are different entities\]. The Table 6.2 shows the refractive indices of different transparent media.

### Optical path

**_Optical path_ of a medium is defined as the distance _d'_ light travels in vacuum in the same time it travels a distance _d_ in the medium.**

Let us consider a medium of refractive index _n_ and thickness _d_. Light travels with a speed _v_ through the medium in a time _t_. The speed of light through the medium is written as,

_v v_

\= = _d t_

_t t d_; ,rewrittenfor as

In the same time _t_, light can cover a longer distance _d'_ in vacuum as it travels with greater speed _c_ in vacuum. It is shown in Figure 6.14. Now, we can wrtite,

As, _c n d is v_ \= ′;The optical path , t e tical path _d'_ is,

′ =_d nd_ (6.17)

The value of _n_ is always greater than 1, for a medium. Thus, the optical path _d'_ of a medium is always greater than _d_.

**EXAMPLE 6.6**

Light travels from air into a glass slab of thickness 50 cm and refractive index 1.5.

(a) What is the speed of light in the glass slab?

(b) What is the time taken by the light to travel through the glass slab?
